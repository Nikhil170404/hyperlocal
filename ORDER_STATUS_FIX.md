# Order Status Update Fix - GroupDetail Page

## Problem
When an admin marked an order as "completed" in the Admin Dashboard, the status was not showing up in the Group Detail page for users.

## Root Cause
The GroupDetail page was only subscribing to the **current** order cycle (linked via `group.currentOrderCycle`). When an admin marks an order as completed, the system typically clears the `currentOrderCycle` field, which caused the page to stop listening for updates to that order.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Real-time Subscription to Recent Cycles
Updated the GroupDetail component to subscribe to recent order cycles in addition to the current active cycle:

```javascript
// Subscribe to recent order cycles (processing & completed)
const cyclesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'orderCycles'),
  where('groupId', '==', groupId),
  where('phase', 'in', ['processing', 'completed']),
  orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
);

const cyclesUnsubscribe = onSnapshot(cyclesQuery, (snapshot) => {
  const cycles = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
  setRecentCycles(cycles.slice(0, 5)); // Keep last 5 cycles
});
```

### 2. Added "Recent Orders" Section
Created a new section at the bottom of the GroupDetail page that displays:
- Recently completed orders
- Orders currently being processed
- User's participation in each order
- Order status badges

### 3. Real-time Updates
The page now updates automatically when:
- Admin marks order as "processing" ✅
- Admin marks order as "completed" ✅
- Order status changes happen in real-time ✅

## Features Added

1. **Real-time Status Updates**: Orders now update immediately when admin changes status
2. **Order History**: Users can see their last 5 orders (processing/completed)
3. **Status Badges**: Clear visual indicators for order status
4. **Participation Info**: Shows user's items and total amount for each order

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/GroupDetail.jsx`:
  - Added `recentCycles` state to track completed orders
  - Added second real-time subscription for processing/completed cycles
  - Added "Recent Orders" UI section

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Place an order in a group as a user
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Change order status from "confirmed" → "processing" → "completed"
4. Check GroupDetail page - you should see:
   - Status updates in real-time
   - Order appears in "Recent Orders" section
   - Status badge shows "Completed" with green color

## Before & After

### Before
- ❌ Completed orders disappeared from view
- ❌ No way to see order history
- ❌ Status updates not reflected

### After
- ✅ Completed orders visible in "Recent Orders"
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Clear order history for last 5 orders
- ✅ User can see their participation details
